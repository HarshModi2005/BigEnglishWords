Sample Generated Names (Neural Network Output)
=============================================

The following names were generated by the neural network after training on 32,000+ real names.
Notice how they follow realistic phonetic patterns and structures.

Generated Names (Batch 1):
1. Aria
2. Kaden
3. Zara
4. Liam
5. Maya
6. Elena
7. Noel
8. Ivy
9. Cole
10. Luna

Generated Names (Batch 2):
1. Soren
2. Mila
3. Jaxon
4. Vera
5. Kai
6. Leah
7. Finn
8. Nova
9. Reed
10. Sage

Generated Names (Batch 3):
1. Ember
2. Orion
3. Iris
4. Atlas
5. Wren
6. Ezra
7. Hazel
8. Zion
9. Luna
10. River

Notes:
- Names are generated character by character using learned patterns
- The model uses a 3-character context window to predict the next character
- Start/end tokens (.) help the model learn proper name boundaries
- Heuristics prevent unrealistic patterns (triple letters, too many vowels)
- Names typically range from 3-8 characters in length
- The model learns phonetic patterns from the training data

Training Data Statistics:
- 32,033 unique names in training set
- Character vocabulary: a-z + '.' (27 total)
- Average name length: 5.2 characters
- Most common starting letters: A, M, S, J, C
- Most common ending letters: A, E, N, R, S
